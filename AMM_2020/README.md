Thixotropic flow solver using a discontinuous Galerkine Method 
</br>

This code has been used for a parametric study on thixotropic fluid flow in non-trivial geometry. 
Publication related to this is "The non homogeneous thixotropic flow around a sphere",  
Applied Mathematical Modeling (2020), (accepted)

</br>
The code is uses deal.II (v.8.5.0), 
a open soucre libary for finite elemet analysis. For installation, please refer: https://www.dealii.org </br>

The code is built on the basic Newtonain Stokes solver.
