Adjoint analysis of thixotropic fluid flow to rheological parameters.
The forward and adjoint flow solution for a sphere is solved  
using a Finite Element Method </br>

This code has been used for research field sensitivity of thixotropic
fluid flow and the publication related to is JNNFM(2018) Vol 257, 72--82.
"Field sensitivity of flow predictions to rheological parameters" 

</br>
The code is uses deal.II, a open soucre libary for finite elemet analysis. For installation, please refer: https://www.dealii.org </br>
