Generalized Newtonian Stokes Flow Solver
based on Finite Element Method </br>

This code has been used for research UQ Analysis of GNF flow simluation
and publication related to this is JNNFM(2019) Vol 271, 104138.
"Uncertainty propagation in simulation predictions
of generalized Newtonian fluid flows" 

</br>
The code is built on deal.II, a open soucre libary for finite elemet analysis. For installation, please refer: https://www.dealii.org </br>

Also it is developed from the basic Newtonain Stokes solver.
